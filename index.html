            You have been selected to participate in an experiment about perception.</p>
        <p class="researchers"                   style="margin-top: 500pt">
            First, you will listen to a series of songs.</p>
        <p class="researchers"                   style="margin-top: 200pt">
            If you have heard any of the songs before, please let us know and we will exempt you from this portion of the experiment.<br>
            Otherwise, listen as you would normally.</p>
        <p class="researchers"                   style="margin-top: 1000pt">
            We will begin now.</p>

        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            The researchers must be queuing the first song.</p>
        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            As you wait quietly, you speculate about what is to be played.<br>
            You're not sure what's taking so long, and you're a little nervous.<br>
            But you are patient enough.</p>
        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            After what feels like about 40 seconds, it begins.</p>

        <p class="you"             id="love"     style="margin-top: 1000pt">
            Of course, you have never heard anything like it.</p>
        <p class="you"             id="end"      style="margin-top: 200pt">
            It ends quickly.</p>

        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            The following silence is freeing. You think about what you've heard.</p>
        <p class="you"             id="months"   style="margin-top: 18000pt">
            You have had enough time to think.</p>

        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            "Hello?"</p>
        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            "Am I still in the experiment?"</p>
        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 3000pt">
            "I thought there was going to be more."</p>
        <p class="you"                           style="margin-top: 10000pt">
            You know you won't—can't—be given an explanation.</p>



        <p class="you researchers" id="years"    style="margin-top: 20000pt;margin-bottom: 0pt">
            Have you gone deaf?</p>
